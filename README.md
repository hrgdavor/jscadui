# usable bits

Most of the things are work in progres, but some parts are pretty ready to be used

- [file-format/3mf-export](./file-format/3mf-export) - [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@jscadui%2F3mf-export.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jscadui%2F3mf-export) 3mf-export (also used by manifold)
- [packages/html-gizmo](./packages/html-gizmo) - [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@jscadui%2Fhtml-gizmo.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jscadui%2Fhtml-gizmo) a gizmo to display current camera direction
- [packages/orbit](./packages/orbit) - [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@jscadui%2Forbit.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jscadui%2Forbit) orbit controls for css and multiple 3d engines, also for use in jscad
- [packages/postmessage](./packages/postmessage) - [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@jscadui%2Fpostmessage.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jscadui%2Fpostmessage) postMessage quality of life improvement

# jscad.app prototype
- [apps/jscad-web](apps/jscad-web) - code for  [jscad.app](https://jscad.app) . It is a nice demo and our attempt at making a an improved version of [openjscad.xyz](https://openjscad.xyz).
- other example apps are much work in progress, you can try them out but they may or may not even work

# Missing features
Missing features that are in openjscad.xyz and not in jscad.app
 - auto zoom (zoom to fit)
 - auto rotate
 - button to open a project
 - language selector
 - pick other themes, aside from light/dark
 - worker timeout (or a button to kill worker if taking too long)
 - keyboard commands and ability to change them
 - warning when leaving / refreshing the page

## Improvements
Things that work better in jscad.app than openjscad.xyz
 - [x] can run remote scripts that import stuff. works on [jscad.app](https://jscad.app/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/master/packages/examples/import/STLImport/index.js) but not on [openjscad.xyz](https://openjscad.xyz/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/master/packages/examples/import/STLImport/index.js)
 - [x] can run scripts that use npm packages (pulls the deps from unkpg)
 - [x] can run es6 modules code
 - [x] can run typescript
 - [x] can run mixed typescript js+require, js+import
 - [x] worker instance is preserved, so caching optimizations are possible between parameter changes

aim is also to simplify integrating worker in other projects

# About jscadui

A jscad UI playground developed here and meant to be later contributed into jscad. This way this is not limited by jscad release cycle.
 - supports: Three.js Babylon.js regl
 - implements no-dep pure js [parameters form generator](./packages/params-form/) based on jscad parameter definitions 
 - allow to be easily used within React, Angular, Vue, Solidj ... or whatever is popular at some point.

## Bring more options for debugging
 - `jscadDebugger(shapes|object)` - function that can be called at any point to see intermediate results from the script 
 - it will also dump it in console, but more importantly also start a parallel instance of jscad that can be used to view
   any model provided via jscadDebugger calls
 - initial `async await` idea was abandoned as it complicates things greatly, and actual debugger in the browser can be used
   to pause the script and to step through the code. 
 - A second instance of jscad can be used to display any shapes needed to be seen while debugging (original instance can be frozen by debugger)
 - the debugger instance of jscad can also be further enhanced to inspect the 3d model

## Some thoughts on how to allow fastest response 

- initial render may be a simple preview with progressive enhancement in background. 
- global precision should be possible so preview has lower precision
- output precision should be configurable so when exporting, recalculation can be done and prepare more precise model in background
- progressive enhancement may be allowed to go to the level of precision that is for export, thus reducing wait time for export
- progressive enhancement should be stopped and restarted on script or parameter change


## Some houghts on parallelizing background work 

- Use of TypedArrays where possible is preferred to allow for sending data between thread with no cost
- it should be examined if regenerating model in the worker is fast enough, as sending TypedArray out removes access for the sender and coordinating who needs which data can be difficult.
- consider a hybrid approach of sending typed arrays data out, to be given back, or regenerated if needed in multiple places
- sets of boolean operations can be done in background
- Making long running operations like booleans interruptible would be ideal.
- calculating operation complexity in advance would be useful (based on precision that can affect the expected output size and amount of calculation)


##  Allowing for changes to be localized instead of recalculating everything

- to extent this can be automatic by marking output geometries with id so if it was already sent from worker to main thread sending can be skipped (and in the end likely also upload to GPU)
- much more is possible if developers are taught some best practices that allow for most performance
