# JSCAD UI test app

you must install modules from root of the project because it uses workspaces

go to root fodler of the project

```
npm i
```

go back to apps/engine-test and run

```
npm start
```


This is a test app for different aspects of JSCAD UI.

It can run multiple engines in parallel or siongle engine on/off to be 
able to sometimes test faster (running only one engine) or to test multiple engines to compare performance or compare any display differences between them.
