## Running Locally

You must install modules from root of the project because it uses npm workspaces.

After cloning the project, go to the root folder of the checked out jscadui repo. Then install npm dependencies by running:

```
npm i
```

To start the local development server, go to the `apps/jscad-web` directory and run:

```
npm start
```

## Deployment

To start the production server run:

```
npm run serve
```
